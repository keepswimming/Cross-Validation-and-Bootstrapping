## Problem 1:  Model Assessment ##
##################################

This problem practices application of proper model assessment techniques, with a multiple linear regression model.

Download the data set *TreesTransformed.csv* (from Homework 2 on Canvas) and read it into R.  Reference with description of the *original* measurements may be found at: [Trees Descriptions](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/trees.html)

```{r echo=FALSE}
trees <- read.csv("TreesTransformed.csv") 
```

The general goal for this dataset is to predict *Volume* based on *Girth* and *Height*, along with some transformations of those variables.  We will be fitting a predictive model using multiple linear regression.  The model is given below:
$Volume = \beta_0+\beta_1\cdot Girth +\beta_2\cdot Height+\beta_3\cdot Girth\cdot Height+\beta_4 \cdot Girth^2+\beta_5\cdot Girth^2\cdot Height$  

Note that there are five predictors, some of which are transformations of the original two variables *Girth* and *Height*, for predicting the value of the response variable *Volume.*  The transformed variables are included in the *TreesTransformed.csv* file, named *GirthHeight* (for $Girth\cdot Height$), *Girth2* (for $Girth^2$), and *Girth2Height* (for $Girth^2\cdot Height$).  

***  

### Question 1 **(2 points)**
Why is *Volume* the most reasonable **response** variable?  *Include real-world reasons (eg. physical practicalities) in your discussion.*

**Text Answer**
This data set provides measurements of the girth, height, and volume of trees. 

Girth is measured in inches, height is measured in feet, and the volume of timber is measured in cubic feet.

As the girth of a tree increase in inches, and height increase as it grows, it is taking up more space in the world. 

Essentially, girth and height are explanatory variables and volume is the most reasonable response variable since they seem to have a relationship.

***

### Questions 2 **(1 point)**
Use multiple linear regression fit the model to the full data set.  Identify the coefficient estimates ($\hat{\beta}_1$, $\hat{\beta}_2$, $\hat{\beta}_3$, $\hat{\beta}_4$, $\hat{\beta}_5$) for the five predictor terms.

How many of the five predictor terms are significant at the $\alpha=0.10$ significance level? : 1  

```{r}
#create a regression model using the predictors. None of these predictors are significant
model = lm(Volume ~ Girth + Height + GirthHeight + Girth2 + Girth2Height, data = trees)
summary(model)
```
```{r}
#written another way
n=dim(trees)[1]
lmfit = lm(Volume ~ ., data=trees)
summary(lmfit)$coefficients[,4] < 0.10
```

How many of the five predictor terms are significant at the 𝛼= 0.10
α = 0.10  I said 0
 significance level? 
**Multiple Choice Answer (AUTOGRADED)**: 

0, 0.595
1,  0.556
2,  0.626
3,  0.573
4, or  0.567  
5    0.792  #significant at the $\alpha=0.10$ significance level == none

*** 

### **We now apply k-fold cross-validation to produce honest predictions, using the process outlined in the next several questions.**

### Question 3 **(1 point)**
Starting with:

`groups = rep(1:5, length=31)`

Set R’s seed to 2:

`set.seed(2)`

and then define cvgroups (random groups for the cross-validation) using the `sample()` function.  

Enter your R code below.

**Code Answer**

```{r}
groups = rep(1:5, length=n)
set.seed(2)
cvgroups = sample(groups,n)
# use 5-fold CV
allpredictedCV = rep(NA,n)
for (i in 1:5) {
 groupi = (cvgroups == i)
 lmfitCV = lm(formula = Volume ~ .,data=trees[!groupi,])
 allpredictedCV[groupi] = predict.lm(lmfitCV,trees[groupi,])
}
allpredictedCV
mean((allpredictedCV-trees$Volume)^2)
```
### Question 4 **(1 point)**
#With the above definition of cvgroups, use the 5-fold cross-validation method to produce honest predicted values.  
#Provide the predicted-y value for the **first** observation: (report answer to two decimal places)
```{r}
obs.pred = data.frame(y = y, yhat = allpredictedCV)
plot(allpredictedCV, y, title = "Compare Observed to Predicted for Model 1",
     ylab = "Observed", xlab = "Predicted") # base-R
gf_point(y ~ yhat, data = obs.pred) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Compare Observed to Predicted for Model 1",
          y = "Observed", x = "Predicted")
```
#Provide the predicted-y value for the first observation: (report answer to two decimal places)

**Code for questions 4-7**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# use 5-fold CV

# Questions 4-5

# Question 6

# report all code in question 7
```
Question 4: Answer for first observation is : 10.56, 

Question 5: Second observation is 9.86
 
**Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:

### Question 5 **(1 point)**
Again using the 5-fold cross-validation method for producing honest predicted values, provide the predicted-y value for the **second** observation: (report answer to two decimal places)


```{r, echo=T}

Tree = c(1:4,":")
Predicted = c("____", format(round(allpredictedCV[1], 2), nsmall = 2), 10.31, 16.36,":")
Observed = c(10.3,10.3,10.2,16.4,":")
TreePredictions = data.frame(Tree=Tree,
                             Predicted=Predicted,
                             Observed=Observed)
knitr::kable(TreePredictions, align = "lcc") 
```


**Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:


### Question 6 **(2 points)**

Calculate and report the $CV_{(5)}$ based on the 5-fold cross-validation: (report answer to three decimal places)
Answer: 9.655 correct

**Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:


### Question 7 **(3 points)**
#Enter your full R code to perform the cross-validation and to compute the $CV_{(5)}$ measure below.  

```{r}
groups = rep(1:5, length=n)
set.seed(2)
cvgroups = sample(groups,n)
# use 5-fold CV
allpredictedCV = rep(NA,n)
for (i in 1:5) {
 groupi = (cvgroups == i)
 lmfitCV = lm(formula = Volume ~ .,data=trees[!groupi,])
 allpredictedCV[groupi] = predict.lm(lmfitCV,trees[groupi,])
}
allpredictedCV
mean((allpredictedCV-trees$Volume)^2)

obs.pred = data.frame(y = y, yhat = allpredictedCV)
plot(allpredictedCV, y, title = "Compare Observed to Predicted for Model 1",
     ylab = "Observed", xlab = "Predicted") # base-R
gf_point(y ~ yhat, data = obs.pred) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Compare Observed to Predicted for Model 1",
          y = "Observed", x = "Predicted")
```


#question 6
```{r}
CVvalue1 = mean((y - allpredictedCV)^2); CVvalue1
```

#**Code Answer**:  (see above)


### We will now use the **bootstrap** to estimate variability of the coefficients.

### Question 8 **(3 points)**:

Program a function, making use of `lm()` to fit the linear regression model, that outputs the six coefficient estimates.   Set R’s seed to 2:

`set.seed(2)`

and then use `boot()` to produce R = 1000 bootstrap estimates for each of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, $\beta_4$, and $\beta_5$.  
Enter your R code below.

**Code for questions 8-10**

```{r}
library(boot)
set.seed(2)
beta.fn = function(inputdata,index) {
lmfitboot = lm(formula = Volume ~ .,data=inputdata[index,])
return(lmfitboot$coef)
}
boot1000 = boot(trees,beta.fn,R=1000)
apply(boot1000$t,2,sd)
lmfitfulldata = lm(formula = Volume ~ .,data=trees);
summary(lmfitfulldata)$coefficients[,2]

```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Questions 9-10

# Question 11

```

### Use your bootstrap results to estimate the **standard errors** for the coefficients.    

### Question 9 **(1 point)**:

Report the standard error for the intercept,

$SE(\hat{\beta_0}) =$   

**Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:90.85


### Question 10 **(1 point)**:

Report the standard error for the first term,

$SE(\hat{\beta_1}) =$   

**Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:
Question 10: SE for Girth is 13.80

### Question 11 **(2 points)**:

The standard errors estimated from usual linear regression methods are shown in the R output below:

```{r, echo=T}
lmfitfulldata = lm(formula = Volume ~ .,data=trees)
knitr::kable(summary(lmfitfulldata)[[4]], align = "lrrrr")
remove(lmfitfulldata)
```

How do these SE values compare to the estimated standard errors computed (via bootstrap) in the previous set of questions?

**Multiple Choice Answer (AUTOGRADED)**: 
Question 11:
A) 	The SE estimates from usual linear regression methods are **greater** than the SE estimates from bootstrap.

	
B)  The SE estimates from usual linear regression methods are **less** than the SE estimates from bootstrap.

	
C) 	The two sets of SE estimates are about the **same**.

Answer is:C

## Problem 2 - Model Selection ##
#################################

This problem practices application of proper model selection techniques, with a multiple linear regression model.

We will continue working with the predictive model using multiple linear regression.  However, we will now consider selection between 6 possible models:

Use LOOCV (note n = 31) method to calculate $CV_{(31)}$ for each of Models 1-6.  

### Question 12 **(4 points)**:

Enter your R code, including performing the cross-validation and computing the $CV_{(31)}$ measure for Model 1 below. 

**Code for questions 12-14**
```{r}
Model1 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + GirthHeight + Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model2 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height)
Model3 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + GirthHeight)
Model4 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model5 = (Volume ~ Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model6 = (Volume ~ Girth2Height)
allpredictedLOOCV = rep(NA,n)

for (i in 1:n) {
 lmfitLOOCV = lm(formula = Model2,data=trees[-i,])
 allpredictedLOOCV[i] = predict.lm(lmfitLOOCV,trees[i,])
}
LOOCVmodel2 = mean((allpredictedLOOCV-trees$Volume)^2); LOOCVmodel2
```
### Question 13 **(1 point)**:

For Model 1, report: $CV_{(31)}$ = **Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:  8.957115


### Question 14 **(1 point)**:

For Model 2, report: $CV_{(31)}$ = **Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:18.15783

### Question 15 **(1 point)**:

Which model would you select based on the values of $CV_{(31)}$ for LOOCV? 
#model 6 since the LOOCV is lowest 


### Question 16 **(1 point)**:

Explain why you chose the model selected in the previous question.

**Text Answer**: Based on the specifications of the models, model 6 has the lowest CV(31) value and is likely the preferred model according to the $CV_{(31)}$ criterion. 


### Using the same split of the data into five sets as you performed in Problem 1, use 5-fold cross-validation method to calculate $CV_{(5)}$ for each of Models 1-6.  

**Code for questions 17-18**
```{r}
# 5-fold CV
nfolds = 5; n=dim(trees)[1] #-create a vector with the sequence 1:5, 6x times. 
groups = rep(1:5, length=31) #manual way probably 
set.seed(2) #reproducibility
#groups = rep(1:nfolds, length=n) # nfolds is number of folds
#-There is 1 remaining observation above 30, so combine "1" at the end. This appears to be setting up 
#-5 folds for CV (because each of the 31 observation's will get labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
cvgroups = sample(groups, n)

############# Linear Model specifications #############
Model1 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + GirthHeight + Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model2 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height)
Model3 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + GirthHeight)
Model4 = (Volume ~ Girth + Height + Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model5 = (Volume ~ Girth2 + Girth2Height)
Model6 = (Volume ~ Girth2Height)

#store all 6 models in a list so they can be accessed within the for loop for model selection.
sixModels= list(Model1,Model2,Model3,Model4,Model5,Model6)	

#create an empty vector to store CV31 results of each model
sixModelsCV = rep(NA,6)

#Loop through the calculation of CV31 calculation 6x times, one for each model.
#m will denote the current model from the allModels list object.
for (m in 1:6) {
  #for each iteration (i.e. model) create an empty vector to store the results of the 1 predicted value
  predictedCV = rep(0,n)
  
  for (i in 1:31){
    #next we will fit the model onto the tree's dataset, but we want to keep out the "test" dataset which is just the current 
    #i'th iteration since this is LOOV.
    fit = lm(formula = allModels[[m]],data=trees[-i,])
    #now that we've fit the model using the "training" data, we can use the model to predict the "test" data.
    #there are 1 observation that are being predicted here in each iteration. 
    #For the returned predicted values, we want to store them the "allpredictedCV" vector, and do it in place of that iteration
    predictedCV[i] = predict.lm(fit,trees[i,])
  }
  #once the CV31 process has taken place, calculate the CV31 score, and store it into the "allmodelCV" vector at the current m 
  #location. Each model will have its CV31 score calculated and stored, and reviewed in the further questions. 
  allmodelCV[m] = sum((predictedCV-trees$Volume)^2)/n
}

y = trees$Volume
allmodelCV[m] = mean((y -  predictedCV )^2); allmodelCV
```
### Question 17 **(1 point)**:

For Model 1, report: $CV_{(5)}$ = **Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:
Answer is:  8.96 

### Question 18 **(1 point)**:

For Model 2, report: $CV_{(5)}$ = **Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:
Answer is: 18.16 

### Question 19 **(1 point)**:

Which model would you select based on the values of $CV_{(5)}$ for  5-fold CV? 

**Multiple Choice Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:  one of  
Model 1, (Girth) = 8.957115
Model 2,  (Height) = 18.157829
Model 3,  (GirthHeight) = 7.904433
Model 4,  (Girth2) = 8.037109
Model 5, or  (Girth2Height) = 7.075083
Model 6  = 6.649682

Answer: Model 6 has the lowest CV(5) value and is likely the preferred value according to the $CV_{(5)}$ criterion. 
 
***

### Question 20 **(2 points)**:

Considering the form of the model that was selected by cross-validation, why does this model make sense from a practical standpoint?

**Text Answer**:
Answer: A tree's height goes in the y dimension (i.e. it moves vertically, only one measurement), whereas the girth is in the x- axis, (its basically the circumference). These two are explicitly linked because of the way a tree grows.

#######################################################
## Problem 3 - Model Assessment & Selection with KNN ##
####################################################### 

This problem practices application of proper model assessment and selection techniques, with the kNN model. 

**Important**:  Use the FNN library for fitting K-nearest neighbors, to obtain consistent answers.

In this problem, you will once again use the K-nearest neighbors approach to analyze the gas mileage of cars. You will be predicting **mpg** from the variables **weight** and **year**, using the **Auto** data set from the ISLR package. 


***

### Question 21 **(4 points)**:

Starting with:

`groups = rep(1:10,length=392)
`

Set R’s seed to 2:

`set.seed(2)`

and use `sample()` to divide the data into **ten** sets.  

Then use 10-fold cross-validation method to calculate $CV_{(10)}$  for **1**-nearest neighbor regression. 

**Important**:  

   * Use only **weight** and **year** (not other variables) as predictors.
   * You will need to standardize each training and validation set inside the cross-validation, according to the means and standard deviations  of the predictors from the training set. 

Enter your R code for performing the cross-validation and computing the $CV_{(10)}$ measure below. 

**Code Answer**: 
# code for #21 #22 

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(FNN)

CV10all = rep(0,30)
for (j in 1:30) {
allpredictedCV = rep(0,n)
 for (i in 1:10) {
 groupi = (cvgroups == i)
 train.Auto = AutoUsed[cvgroups != i,]
 train.Auto.std = scale(train.Auto)
 valid.Auto = AutoUsed[cvgroups == i,]
 valid.Auto.std = scale(valid.Auto,
 center = attr(train.Auto.std, "scaled:center"),
 scale = attr(train.Auto.std, "scaled:scale"))
 predictedCV = knn.reg(train.Auto.std, valid.Auto.std, Auto$mpg[!groupi],
k = j)
 allpredictedCV[groupi] = predictedCV$pred
 }
 CV10 = sum((allpredictedCV-Auto$mpg)^2)/n
 CV10all[j] = CV10
}
CV10all
```

### Question 22 **(2 points)**:

Report the value.   

$CV_{(10)}$ = **Numeric Answer (AUTOGRADED)**
#Answer is 13.49691, round to 2 places: 13.50

***

### Question 23 **(1 point)**:

In general, how should the $CV_{(10)}$ value compare to the value of MSE (computed by reusing the same data used to fit the model)?

**Multiple Choice Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:  one of 

$CV_{(10)} > MSE$,  
$CV_{(10)} < MSE$, or  
$CV_{(10)} \approx MSE$

***
##Answer: a) CV10 will larger because raw MSE should perform perfectly if you use the same data you trained with, to test with. 
#It already knows what those data points are.

### Question 24 **(3 points)**:

Consider models 1-30 as the k-nearest neighbors regression for values of k from 1 to 30. Using the same split of the data into ten sets as you performed in the Model assessment section, use 10-fold cross-validation method to calculate CV(10) for each of Models 1-30; remember to re-standardize each training set inside the cross-validation. Make a plot of the CV(10) as a function of k.
Embed your plot to the Quiz question.

library(FNN)
data(Auto)
names(Auto)
n=dim(Auto)[1]
AutoUsed = cbind(Auto$weight,Auto$year)
groups = rep(1:10,length=392)
set.seed(2)
cvgroups = sample(groups,n)
CV10all = rep(0,30)
for (j in 1:30) {
allpredictedCV = rep(0,n)
 for (i in 1:10) {
 groupi = (cvgroups == i)
 train.Auto = AutoUsed[cvgroups != i,]
 train.Auto.std = scale(train.Auto)
 valid.Auto = AutoUsed[cvgroups == i,]

 allpredictedCV[groupi] = predictedCV$pred
 }
 CV10 = sum((allpredictedCV-Auto$mpg)^2)/n
 CV10all[j] = CV10
}
CV10all
```

#finally, plot k and the allCV values
```{r}
plot(k, CV10all,type="l")
```

### Question 25 **(2 points)**:

Which k (number of nearest neighbors) would you select based on the values of $CV_{(10)}$ for 10-fold CV?

**Numeric (Integer) Answer (AUTOGRADED)**:  
 #Answer:   k=18
***

### Question 26 **(2 points)**:

Explain why you chose the k value specified in the previous question. *Comment on both model predictive ability and model complexity.*

**Text Answer**: I chose k = 18 because this appears to have the lowest CV10 error value. Although it is arguable that 
CV10 values for k leading into 17 are on the decline, whereas values after 17 start to show an increase in CV10 error.
